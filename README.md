### About Me
I spend most of my time with web development. Usually in ASP .NET or PHP. I want to get more into web apps and perhaps desktop apps too. I'm not the most competent of designers but that doesn't usually stop me. I occasionally dabble in game dev and vfx from time to time. I'm also fascinated with the ever-evolving world of "AI" tools as well as the complex world of cyber security
